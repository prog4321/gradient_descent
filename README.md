### <ins>GRADIENT DESCENT (A MORE INTUITIVE EXPLANATION)</ins>

#### <ins>OBJECTIVE</ins>
<p>Gradient descent is a core topic in machine learning and neural networks.

To have a thorough understanding of gradient descent, it is important to understand how, and why, its underlying mathematics work.

In this notebook I will present a step-by-step breakdown of the mathematics involved. I will also demonstrate how a simple linear regression model using gradient descent can be built from the ground up using Python. That way, we can really see the gradient descent algorithm in action.

I hope it can provide the reader with a clear, intuitive and yet technically accurate understanding of this topic. I will use only the necessary maths, and Python code with explanations.

This notebook documents my own understanding of the topic. Please let me know if you spot any errors or inaccuracies! Thank you.
